Big Ticket TODO:

- method of assigning a fixed set of resources/weights to a mask, one at a time - allocation function
- is there a good way of applying a mask to a bunch of starts? a "apply_mask_to_starts" command or something like that? 
- balance commands
- documentation
- tutorials
- apply_shape_to_mask
- new_mask_from_magic_wand
- test difference/merge
- tests


1.) find starts
2.) for each start:
    - calculate distance between them to calculate average distance
    - assign tiles
        - 1.) generate a soft circle mask around them based on average distance somehow
        - 2.) calculate a "path distance" to each tile
            - e.g. coast tiles have a distance of "2", hills 1.4, or something
            - need a* search
            - allocate one tile at a time per civ
        - 3.) bfc assignment
            - evaluate_bfc value function
            - tiles allocated in chunks
        - 4.) breadth-first search, like novice's tool
        - 5.) weighted average of all 4 approaches
        
        

weights to do:

terrains:
    standard versions of each resource
    variant versions of each resource, tagged as such
    "bare" versions of each resource
    plain land
weights:
    %landfood
    %seafood
    %any_strategic
    %standard_coast
    %standard_ocean
    %standard_land
    %ancient_luxury
    %classical_luxury
