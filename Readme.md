Civ4 Map Cad is a tool for making multiplayer maps for Civilization 4! The twin goals of this project is to a.) provide a way of building maps piece-wise, rather than trusting a single script to generate the whole thing at once and to b.) provide a really, really good balance checker. Together, they'll allow a map designer to adjust specific pieces of his map based on the feedback of the balance tool without disrupting the entire map.

Features:
* Powerful layer-based map manipulation tools that allow you to generate terrain out of arbitrary shapes and functions, cut, paste, and more!
* Highly sophisticated balance tools ensure that your map is fair for all players even for highly asymetrical maps!
* Script-based design and a detailed HTML view of the maps allows for easy collaboration with fellow mapmakers and easy balance adjustments!
* Command line interface to map creation allows you to play around with Civ while at work - and it'll even still look like you're doing work!
* Generate starting sims for multiplayer games!
